Excel_Project- "Analyzing Social Media Usage Patterns and Their Impact on Productivity Among Indian Users: An Excel-Based Comprehensive Study"

Step-by-Step Comprehensive Analysis:-

Step 1: Data Preparation
1.	Load Data into Excel:
o	Import the dataset into an Excel workbook.

3.	Filter Data:
o	Use Excel’s filter feature to select only the rows where Location is India.

o	Go to the "Data" tab and click on "Filter".

o	Apply the filter to the Location column and select "India".

5.	Data Cleaning:
o	Ensure there are no blank cells in crucial columns (e.g., UserID, Platform, Total Time Spent).

o	If necessary, use the Remove Duplicates feature in the Data tab to clean the data.

7.	Standardizing Data:
   
o	Ensure consistency in categorical data (e.g., convert all TRUE/FALSE to YES/NO or yes/no).

o	Format numerical data correctly (e.g., ensure Income is in the same currency format).

Step 2: Data Analysis Using Pivot Tables and Charts

1.	Create Pivot Tables:
   
o	"User Engagement and Time Spent by Platform":

	Insert a pivot table: Go to Insert > Pivot Table.

	Select Platform for rows and UserId , Video Id and Total Time Spent for values.

	Summarize UserId as count , Video Id and Total Time Spent for values values by sum.

o	Average Productivity Loss by Social Media Platform:

	Insert a pivot table.

	Select Platform for rows and Productivity Loss for values.

	Summarize values by average.

o	User Motivations for Social Media Usage:

	Insert a pivot table.

	Select Watch Reason for rows and Total Time Spent for values.

	Set Total Time Spent  to average
 
o	Average Time Spent vs. Addiction Level:

	Insert a pivot table.

	Select Addiction Level for rows and Total Time Spent for values.

	Summarize values by average.

o	Video Engagement and User Count Across Different Content Categories:

	Insert a pivot table.

	Select Video Category for rows and Video ID and User ID  for values.

	Summarize values by sum .

2.	Create Charts:

o	Clustered Bar Chart for Average Total Time Spent By Platform :

	Use the pivot table created above.

	Go to Insert > Bar Chart.

o	Pie Chart for User Distribution by Profession:

	Use the pivot table for users by profession.

	Go to Insert > Pie Chart.

o	Line Chart for Average Productivity Loss by Platform:

	Use the pivot table for productivity loss.

	Go to Insert > Line Chart.

Step 3:	Formulas and Advanced Features:
   
o	VLOOKUP Example:

Scenario 1: Retrieve User's Total Time Spent on Social Media Based on UserID

	Create a new sheet for lookup tables.

	=VLOOKUP(A2, sheet1!A1:AE1000, 11, FALSE)

	Looks up the value in cell A2 of "LookupSheet" (e.g., "U123").

	Searches for this value in the first column of the range A1 in "sheet1".

	Retrieves the value from the 11th column of the same row where the lookup value is found.

	Ensures an exact match with FALSE.

Scenario 2: Find the Satisfaction Level for a Given(Starting three in the sheet )Video ID

	=VLOOKUP(J4, 'only india dataset'!M1:ME1000, 11, FALSE)

	J4: Lookup value (e.g., "V123").

	only india dataset'!M1:ME1000: Data range to search in (columns M to ME).

	Column number to return the value from (11th column in the range).

	FALSE: Exact match required.

o	HLOOKUP Example:

Scenario: find the age of a user based on their UserID.

	=HLOOKUP(B3, 'only india dataset'!A1:AE2, 2, FALSE)

	B3: Lookup value.

	'only india dataset'!A1:AE2: Search range; headers in row 1, data in row 2.

	Return value from the 2nd row.

	FALSE: Exact match required.

	Autofill all cells 

o Function:

IF Function

Purpose: To perform conditional checks and return specific values based on a condition.
Syntax:
=IF(logical_test, value_if_true, value_if_false)

Scenario: You want to check if the total time spent on social media (in "DataSheet") is greater than 60 min and return "Exceeds Limit" if true, or "Within Limit" if false.

=IF(VLOOKUP(A4,'only india dataset'!A1:AE1000,11,FALSE)>60,"Exceeds Limit","Within Limit")

COUNTIF Function

Purpose: Counts the number of cells in a range that meet a specified condition.
Formula Syntax:
=COUNTIF(range, criteria)

Example: To count the number of users who own property:
=COUNTIF('only india dataset'!G1:G1000, "Yes")

SUMIF Function

Purpose: Adds the cells specified by a given condition or criteria.
Formula Syntax:

=SUMIF(range, criteria, [sum_range])

Example: To sum the total time spent on the platform by users who have an income above Rs.50,000:
=SUMIF('only india dataset'!E1:E1000, ">50000", 'only india dataset'!K1:K1000) 

•	'only india dataset'!E1:E1000: Range of cells to evaluate the criteria (income).

•	">50000": Condition that the income must be greater than $50,000.

•	'only india dataset'!K1:K1000: Range of cells from which to sum the values (total time spent) if the condition is met.

In short: This formula sums the values in column K (total time spent) for rows where the corresponding value in column E (income) is greater than $50,000.

AVERAGEIF Function
Purpose: Calculates the average of cells that meet a specified condition.
Formula Syntax:
=AVERAGEIF(range, criteria, [average_range])

Example: To find the average satisfaction level for users who use the Instagram platform:
=AVERAGEIF(Platform:Platform, "TikTok", Satisfaction:Satisfaction)

•	only india dataset'!J1:J1000: Platform data range.

•	"Instagram": Criteria for the platform.

•	'only india dataset'!W1:W1000: Range to average (satisfaction level).

Result: Calculates the average satisfaction level for users who use Instagram.
By using these functions, you can effectively analyze and derive insights from your dataset.

o Conditional Formatting:

•	Highlight cells Total Time Spent Over 60 Minutes.

Select the column, go to Home > Conditional Formatting > New Rule > Format cells that contain.


•	Top 10% of Video Engagement

Conditional Formatting > Top/Bottom Rules > Top 10% > Choose Format

•	Color Scale for Satisfaction Levels

Conditional Formatting > Color Scales > Choose a color gradient

Conditional formatting helps in visually analyzing patterns and outliers in your data, making it easier to interpret and present.

o	Slicers in Pivot Tables:

	To add interactivity to pivot tables, use slicers.

	Select a pivot table, go to Analyze > Insert Slicer, and choose fields like Gender or DeviceType.

	For adding more than one pivot table to same slicer, go to report connect and add it ( features should be same in all pivot tables then only slicer added to more than one pivot table)

o	Data Validation:

	To ensure consistent data entry, use data validation.

	Select the cells for data entry, go to Data > Data Validation, and set criteria (e.g., only allow specific text values).

Step 4: Advanced Analysis and Features

1.	Correlation Analysis:

o	Prepare Data for Correlation Analysis:

	Ensure the data is cleaned and filtered for users in India.

	Select relevant columns for correlation analysis, such as Age, Income, Total Time Spent, Number of Sessions, Productivity Loss, Satisfaction, Self Control, and Addiction Level.

o	Correlation coefficients range from -1 to 1:

	1 indicates a perfect positive correlation.

	-1 indicates a perfect negative correlation.

	0 indicates no correlation.

o	Look for high absolute values (close to 1 or -1) to identify strong correlations.

o	Possible Interesting Correlations:

A.	Total Time Spent vs. Productivity Loss:

o	Examine how the total time spent on social media correlates with productivity loss.

B.	Age vs. Time Spent On Video:

o	Analyze if different age groups spend different amounts of time on videos.

C.	Income vs. Engagement:

o	Investigate if higher income users engage more or less with content.


2. Visualizing Correlations
You might want to visualize these correlations for better insights:

Scatter Plots:

o	Create scatter plots for pairs of variables with high correlation values to see the relationship visually.
